# Frequently Asked Questions

## Type Safety Issues

### "Property does not exist on type" when using typed hooks

Make sure you're importing from your generated helpers file, not directly from `skybridge/web`:

```typescript
// Wrong
import { useCallTool } from "skybridge/web";

// Right
import { useCallTool } from "../skybridge";
```

### No autocomplete for tool names

Check that:
1. Your server exports `type AppType = typeof server`
2. Your `skybridge.ts` imports this type correctly
3. You're using [method chaining](/concepts/type-safety#method-chaining-requirement) when registering tools

## Network Issues

### Seeing the error "CORS error: Permission was denied for this request to access the `unknown` address space."

Your widget needs to access the local dev server over your local network. This error appears when your browser blocks such access.

**To fix this, enable local network access in your browser settings so it can connect to localhost and other local network addresses.**
