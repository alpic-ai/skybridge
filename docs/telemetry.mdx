# Telemetry

Skybridge collects anonymous usage telemetry to help us understand how the CLI is being used and improve the developer experience. **Telemetry is completely optional** and you can opt out at any time.

<Info>
**Your Privacy Matters**

We only collect aggregate usage data. We never collect personal information, project code, file contents, or any sensitive data.
</Info>

## What We Collect

When you run a Skybridge CLI command, we collect the following anonymous information:

| Data | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Command** | The CLI command that was executed | `dev`, `build`, `start` |
| **Version** | The Skybridge CLI version | `1.2.3` |
| **Machine ID** | A random UUID generated on first run | `a1b2c3d4-...` |
| **Session ID** | A unique ID for this command execution | `e5f6g7h8-...` |
| **Outcome** | Whether the command succeeded or failed | `success` or `failure` |
| **Error** | Error message if the command failed | `Port 3000 in use` |
| **Platform** | Your operating system | `darwin`, `linux`, `win32` |
| **Node Version** | Your Node.js version | `v24.0.0` |
| **Is CI** | Whether running in a CI environment | `true` or `false` |

### What We Don't Collect

- ❌ Project names or file paths
- ❌ Source code or file contents
- ❌ Environment variables or secrets
- ❌ IP addresses or location data
- ❌ Personal identifiable information

## Why We Collect Telemetry

Telemetry helps us:

- **Understand usage patterns** — Which commands are most used? Where do developers spend time?
- **Identify common errors** — What problems do developers encounter most frequently?
- **Prioritize improvements** — Which platforms and Node versions should we support?
- **Measure adoption** — How is Skybridge being adopted over time?

## How to Opt Out

Telemetry configuration is **machine-wide**, not project-specific. Your preference is stored in `~/.skybridge/config.json` and applies to all Skybridge projects on the same machine.

You have multiple ways to disable telemetry:

### Using the CLI

The easiest way to disable telemetry:

```bash
skybridge telemetry disable
```

To re-enable it later:

```bash
skybridge telemetry enable
```

Check your current telemetry status:

```bash
skybridge telemetry status
```

### Using Environment Variables

Set `SKYBRIDGE_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` to disable telemetry:

```bash
# In your shell profile (.bashrc, .zshrc, etc.)
export SKYBRIDGE_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
```

Or use the standard `DO_NOT_TRACK` environment variable:

```bash
export DO_NOT_TRACK=1
```

### Configuration File

Telemetry settings are stored in `~/.skybridge/config.json`:

```json
{
  "machineId": "a1b2c3d4-e5f6-...",
  "telemetry": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

<Note>
Environment variables take precedence over the configuration file. If `SKYBRIDGE_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` or `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` is set, telemetry will be disabled regardless of the config file setting.
</Note>

## CI Environments

In CI environments (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.), telemetry is **enabled by default** and the machine ID is set to the CI provider name (e.g., `GitHub Actions`).

To disable telemetry in CI, set the environment variable in your CI configuration:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions example
env:
  SKYBRIDGE_TELEMETRY_DISABLED: "1"
```

## Debug Mode

To see what telemetry data would be sent without actually sending it, enable debug mode:

```bash
SKYBRIDGE_TELEMETRY_DEBUG=1 skybridge dev
```

This will print the telemetry event to stderr instead of sending it, useful for understanding exactly what data is collected.

## Data Handling

- Telemetry data is sent to [PostHog](https://posthog.com/), a privacy-focused analytics platform
- Data is stored on PostHog's US servers
- We retain aggregated data for product analytics purposes
- Individual events are anonymized and cannot be linked to specific users
