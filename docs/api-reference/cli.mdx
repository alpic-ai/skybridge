---

Skybridge provides two CLI tools: the main `skybridge` CLI for development and production workflows, and `create-skybridge` for bootstrapping new projects.

## Skybridge CLI

The main CLI is available as both `skybridge` and `sb` commands after installing `skybridge` in your project.

### skybridge dev

Start the development server with hot module reloading and DevTools.

```bash
skybridge dev
```

**What it does:**
- Starts a development server at `http://localhost:3000/`
- Opens DevTools for local testing at `http://localhost:3000/`
- Exposes MCP server at `http://localhost:3000/mcp`
- Enables file watching with automatic server restart
- Enables Hot Module Reloading (HMR) for widgets

#### Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--use-forwarded-host` | Uses the forwarded host header to construct widget URLs instead of localhost. Useful when accessing the dev server through a tunnel (e.g., ngrok). |

The `--use-forwarded-host`  allows your widgets to work on any device connected to the internet, not just on your local machine. Useful when developing on multiple devices or when you need to test your app from different devices.

**Important limitation:** Hot Module Reloading (HMR) is not available when using `--use-forwarded-host` because HMR uses a different port than the dev server and requires the WebSocket Secure (WSS) protocol, which most tunnel solutions don't support. To see your changes during development, simply reopen the conversation in ChatGPT to refresh the widget.

**Example with ngrok:**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Skybridge
skybridge dev --use-forwarded-host

# Terminal 2: Expose your local server
ngrok http 3000
```

**Note:** Only use `--use-forwarded-host` when you need to develop or test on multiple devices. For local-only development, the standard `skybridge dev` command is sufficient.

When using `--use-forwarded-host`, Skybridge will use the ngrok URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app`) for widget URLs instead of `localhost:3000`.

### skybridge build

Build your widgets and MCP server for production deployment.

```bash
skybridge build
```

**What it does:**

1. **Building widgets** - Compiles your React widgets using Vite
2. **Compiling server** - Transpiles TypeScript server code
3. **Copying static assets** - Moves built assets to the `dist/` directory

The output is placed in the `dist/` directory, ready for production deployment.

---

### skybridge start

Start the production server.

```bash
skybridge start
```

**Requirements:**
- Must run `skybridge build` first
- Requires `dist/index.js` to exist

**What it does:**
- Runs the compiled server from `dist/index.js`
- Sets `NODE_ENV=production`
- Serves the MCP endpoint at `http://localhost:3000/mcp`
- Serves pre-built widget assets from `/assets`

---

## create-skybridge

A standalone CLI for bootstrapping new Skybridge projects.

```bash
npm create skybridge@latest [directory]
```

Or with other package managers:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm create skybridge@latest
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm create skybridge@latest
```
```bash yarn
yarn create skybridge
```
```bash bun
bun create skybridge
```
</CodeGroup>

### Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `[directory]` | Target directory for the new project. If not specified, you'll be prompted to enter a project name. Use `.` to create in the current directory. |

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-h, --help` | Show help message |
| `--overwrite` | Remove existing files in target directory without prompting |
| `--immediate` | Install dependencies and start the development server automatically after scaffolding |

### Examples

**Create a new project interactively:**

```bash
npm create skybridge@latest
```

**Create a project in a specific directory:**

```bash
npm create skybridge@latest my-app
```

**Create in current directory, overwrite existing files, and start immediately:**

```bash
npm create skybridge@latest . --overwrite --immediate
```

### What it creates

The scaffolder copies a starter template that includes:

- `server/index.ts` - MCP server with example tools
- `web/` - React widgets with example components
- `package.json` - Pre-configured with all dependencies
- `tsconfig.json` files - TypeScript configuration
- `vite.config.ts` - Vite configuration for widget bundling
- `nodemon.json` - File watching configuration for development

## Package Manager Scripts

When you create a new Skybridge project, the `package.json` includes these scripts:

| Script | Command | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `dev` | `skybridge dev` | Start development server |
| `build` | `skybridge build` | Build for production |
| `start` | `skybridge start` | Start production server |

Run them with your package manager:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm run dev
npm run build
npm start
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm dev
pnpm build
pnpm start
```
```bash yarn
yarn dev
yarn build
yarn start
```
```bash bun
bun dev
bun build
bun start
```
```bash deno
deno task dev
deno task build
deno task start
```
</CodeGroup>
