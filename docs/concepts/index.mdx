Four concepts power Skybridge:

  <Card title="Data Flow" icon="arrows-rotate" href="/concepts/data-flow">
    How data moves between server, ChatGPT, and widget
  </Card>
  <Card title="LLM Context Sync" icon="brain" href="/concepts/llm-context-sync">
    Keep the model aware of widget state via `data-llm`
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fast Iteration" icon="bolt" href="/concepts/fast-iteration">
    Local development with instant feedback
  </Card>
  <Card title="Type Safety" icon="shield-check" href="/concepts/type-safety">
    End-to-end TypeScript types from server to widget
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
**Start with Data Flow** — it establishes the three-actor model that other concepts build on.
