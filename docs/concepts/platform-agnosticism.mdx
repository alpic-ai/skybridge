description: "How Skybridge abstracts runtime differences so your apps work across ChatGPT and MCP Apps hosts."
---

Skybridge is designed to be **runtime-agnostic**. Your widget code works the same whether it runs in ChatGPT (via Apps SDK) or in MCP-compatible clients like Goose.

## The Problem

Different AI platforms use different APIs to communicate with embedded widgets:

- **ChatGPT** uses the Apps SDK with `window.openai` global
- **MCP Apps** use JSON-RPC postMessage protocol (MCP ext-apps spec)

Without abstraction, you'd need to write different code for each platform—or lock yourself into one ecosystem.

## Skybridge's Solution

Skybridge introduces an **adaptor layer** that normalizes these differences:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph Code["Your Widget Code"]
        Hooks["useToolInfo, useCallTool, etc."]
    end

    Code --> Skybridge

    subgraph Skybridge["Skybridge Hooks"]
        Unified["Unified React Interface"]
    end

    Skybridge --> AppsSdk
    Skybridge --> McpApp

    subgraph AppsSdk["Apps SDK Adaptor"]
        OpenAI["window.openai"]
    end

    subgraph McpApp["MCP App Adaptor"]
        JsonRpc["JSON-RPC Bridge"]
    end

    AppsSdk --> ChatGPT["ChatGPT"]
    McpApp --> Others["Goose / Other Hosts"]
```

Skybridge automatically detects which runtime is available and uses the appropriate adaptor.

## Runtime Compatibility

Not all features are available on all platforms. See the [API Reference](/api-reference#runtime-compatibility) for a full compatibility matrix.

**Key differences:**
- `useFiles` is **Apps SDK only**
- `useRequestModal` MCP Apps support coming soon (will render in-iframe)
- `useDisplayMode` doesn't support "modal" mode in MCP Apps
- `useWidgetState` is **Apps SDK only**

<Tip>
Check individual hook documentation for runtime-specific notes and limitations.
