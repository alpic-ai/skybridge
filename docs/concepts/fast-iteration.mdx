title: Fast Iteration
description: "Develop Apps locally with Skybridge's DevTools and Vite HMR for instant feedback without ngrok."

**Problem:** Testing widgets in ChatGPT's dev mode is slow. It requires ngrok tunneling, manual refreshes, and provides limited debugging feedback.

**Solution:** Skybridge includes DevTools and a Vite HMR plugin that let you develop widgets entirely on your machine with instant feedback.

## The Challenge

When building Apps the traditional way, your development loop looks like:

1. Make a code change
2. Restart your server
3. Tunnel with ngrok (if not already running)
4. Go to ChatGPT dev mode
5. Trigger the tool manually by chatting
6. Wait for the widget to load
7. See if your change worked
8. Repeat

This can take 30-60 seconds per iteration. With complex widgets, that adds up fast.

## The Skybridge Approach

With Skybridge, the loop becomes:

1. Make a code change
2. See it instantly in your browser

That's it. DevTools mocks the ChatGPT environment, and Vite's HMR updates your widget without a full reload.

## DevTools

When you run `pnpm dev`, Skybridge starts:
- Your MCP server at `http://localhost:3000/mcp`
- DevTools UI at `http://localhost:3000/`

The DevTools UI provides:
- **Tool listing** - See all registered tools and widgets
- **Input forms** - Test tools with custom inputs
- **Widget preview** - Render widgets in a mocked ChatGPT environment

## HMR with Vite Plugin

Skybridge includes a Vite plugin that enables Hot Module Replacement for widgets:

```typescript
// vite.config.ts
import { skybridge } from "skybridge/web";
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), skybridge()],
});
```

The plugin:
- **Auto-discovers widgets** in `src/widgets/` (both flat files and directories)
- **Enables HMR** so changes appear instantly without page reload
- **Transforms `data-llm`** attributes at build time
- **Configures build output** with proper asset paths

<Info>
**Starter template required**

These features require the Skybridge starter template structure (`pnpm create skybridge`). If you're adding Skybridge to an existing app, you'll need to configure the Vite plugin manually.
</Info>

When you save a file, only the changed component re-renders. Form inputs, scroll position, and local state are preserved.

## Automatic Environment Detection

Your widget code works identically in ChatGPT and local DevTools. Skybridge detects the environment and uses the appropriate communication layer:

| Environment | Communication |
|-------------|---------------|
| ChatGPT | `window.openai` API |
| DevTools | postMessage to DevTools |

You don't need to know which is active—just use the hooks.

## When to Use What

**DevTools (90% of development time)**
- Rapid UI iteration
- Testing tool inputs/outputs
- Debugging state management
- Day-to-day development

**ChatGPT Dev Mode (10% of development time)**
- Final integration testing
- Real LLM conversation flow
- Verifying `data-llm` context
- Pre-ship validation

<Tip>
**Workflow**

Build locally → validate in ChatGPT → ship. See [Test Your App](/quickstart/test-your-app#testing-in-chatgpt) for ChatGPT setup.

## DevTools Features

The DevTools UI includes:

### Tool Inspector
See all registered tools and their schemas. Click to fill input forms automatically.

### Widget Preview
Renders your widget in an iframe with mocked `window.openai`. Supports:
- Theme switching (light/dark)
- Display mode switching (pip/inline/fullscreen)
- Locale changing


### Response Inspector
View the full tool response including `content`, `structuredContent`, and `_meta`.
