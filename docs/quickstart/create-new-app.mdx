The fastest way to start building is using our starter template. It comes pre-configured with an MCP server, a basicUI widget, and a full dev server with a local emulator and HMR.

<Tip>
**Don't know if you should start with a ChatGPT or MCP App?** It doesn't matter! With Skybridge, you build your App once, and it runs seamlessly with both runtimes.
</Tip>

## Bootstrap your project

Set up your app with a single command:


<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm create skybridge@latest my-app
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm create skybridge my-app
```
```bash yarn
yarn create skybridge my-app
```
```bash bun
bun create skybridge my-app
```
```bash deno
deno init --npm skybridge my-app
```
</CodeGroup>


<Info>
**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have:
- **Node.js 24+**
- **[Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download)** for exposing your local server
- Basic knowledge of **React** and **TypeScript**
- Familiarity with **Zod** for schema validation (we'll use it for type-safe tool definitions)
</Info>

<Warning>
**Widget Naming Convention**

Widget file name must match the registration name (e.g., `"my-widget"` → `my-widget.tsx`). See [registerWidget](/api-reference/register-widget#name).
</Warning>

## Start the development server

Run the development server from the root directory:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm run dev
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm dev
```
```bash yarn
yarn dev
```
```bash bun
bun dev
```
```bash deno
deno task dev
```
</CodeGroup>

This runs the `skybridge` command, which starts a development server with the following features:

### What it does

The `skybridge` command:
- **Starts an Express server** on port 3000 by default that packages:
  - An MCP endpoint on `/mcp` - the App Backend
  - A React application on Vite HMR dev server - the App Frontend
- **Watches for file changes** using nodemon, automatically restarting the server when you modify server-side code

### Development workflow

When you run `skybridge`:
1. The server starts and displays the welcome screen in your terminal
2. You can access **DevTools** at `http://localhost:3000/` by default to test your app locally
3. The **MCP server** is available at `http://localhost:3000/mcp` by default
4. **File watching** is enabled - changes to server code will automatically restart the server
5. **Hot Module Reload (HMR)** is active for Widgets components - changes appear instantly in the host without reconnecting

You can change the port with `skybridge dev --port <port>` or by setting `PORT`.
