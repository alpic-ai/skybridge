**Alpic** is a developer-friendly cloud platform for deploying and hosting MCP Apps. This guide will walk you through the process of deploying your app using the Alpic CLI.

Alternatively, you can deploy your Skybridge app as a Node.js server on any compatible infrastructure provider.

## Authentication

At the moment, only API key authentication is supported.

Set the `ALPIC_API_KEY` environment variable before running any deploy. You can create an API key from **Team settings** in the [Alpic dashboard](https://app.alpic.ai).

```bash
export ALPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

## Deploy command

Install the Alpic CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g alpic
```

Then run:

```bash
alpic deploy [directory]
```

You can also use `npx alpic deploy` without a global install.

**Arguments**

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `directory` | Directory to deploy (default: current directory). |

**Examples**

Deploy the current directory:

```bash
alpic deploy
```

Deploy a specific app directory:

```bash
alpic deploy ./my-app
```

## What it does

1. **Resolves project** — If the directory is not yet linked to an Alpic project, you are prompted to create a new project or link to an existing one. Project and environment are stored in `.alpic/project.json` for future deploys.

2. **Collects source files** — Uses Git to determine which files to pack. Git must be installed.

3. **Uploads and deploys** — Creates a gzipped tarball, uploads it to Alpic, and triggers a deployment.

## First-time deploy

When the directory is not linked to a project, you will be asked to:

- **Create a new project** — Enter a project name, choose a runtime (Node.js 24, Node.js 22, Python 3.14, or Python 3.13), and optionally set a root directory within the project. The CLI may suggest a runtime based on your project files (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.).

- **Link to an existing project** — Select a project and environment from your Alpic team.

After that, `.alpic/project.json` is created so the next `alpic deploy` uses the same project and environment without prompting.

## Output

On success, the CLI prints the MCP server URL. You can also open the deployment details page in the Alpic dashboard to follow logs and status.
