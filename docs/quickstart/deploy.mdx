You can deploy your Skybridge App as a Node.js server on any compatible infrastructure provider.

Below are some easy options closely integrated with Skybridge.

## Alpic Cloud platform

### Instant deploy to Alpic

**[Alpic](https://alpic.ai)** is a developer-friendly cloud platform for deploying and hosting MCP Apps. It is also the company behind Skybridge :) 

To deploy your App on Alpic you can:
1. Create a free account on [app.alpic.ai](https://app.alpic.ai)
2. Deploy your App either by:
   - Pushing your App to Github, and connecting it to Alpic for automatic deployment at each commit.
   - Using the [Alpic CLI](https://docs.alpic.ai/cli/overview):

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm run deploy
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm deploy
```
```bash yarn
yarn deploy
```
```bash bun
bun run deploy
```
</CodeGroup>

Once your App is deployed, you will be able to access specific MCP analytics, logs, and test your app remotely in the Alpic Playground.

Learn more about deploying to Alpic in the [Alpic documentation](https://docs.alpic.ai/).


### Alpic MCP App

Alpic also provides its own [MCP App](https://docs.alpic.ai/features/mcp-server) that lets you manage your apps directly from your favorite MCP Client. Connect to the Alpic MCP Server using:
```
https://mcp.alpic.ai/mcp
```
