When you're ready to deploy your ChatGPT App to production, Skybridge provides two commands: `skybridge build` to compile your app, and `skybridge start` to run it in production mode.

## Build for Production

Before deploying, you need to build your application. Run the build command from your project root:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm run build
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm build
```
```bash yarn
yarn build
```
```bash bun
bun build
```
```bash deno
deno task build
```
</CodeGroup>

This runs the `skybridge build` command, which compiles your widgets and server code for production.

## Start Production Server

Once your app is built, start the production server:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm start
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm start
```
```bash yarn
yarn start
```
```bash bun
bun start
```
```bash deno
deno task start
```
</CodeGroup>

This runs the `skybridge start` command, which starts your production server.

### How it works

The production server runs your compiled application from the `dist/` directory with `NODE_ENV=production`. Unlike the development server, it:

- **Serves pre-built assets** - Widgets and styles are served as static files from `/assets` (compiled during `skybridge build`)
- **MCP endpoint** - Exposes your MCP server at `/mcp` for ChatGPT to connect to
- **No dev tools** - DevTools and Vite dev server are excluded in production for better performance
- **Optimized rendering** - Uses production templates that load pre-bundled JavaScript and CSS files

The server listens on port 3000 by default. When deployed, ChatGPT connects to your MCP endpoint (e.g., `https://your-domain.com/mcp`) to access your tools and widgets.
