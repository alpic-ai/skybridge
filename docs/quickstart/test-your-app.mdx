title: Test Your App
description: "Test your app locally with DevTools, or in ChatGPT Developer Mode and compatible MCP Clients for integration testing."
---

Skybridge provides two ways to test your app: **local DevTools** for rapid iteration, and production testing in ChatGPT and compatible MCP Apps Clients.

## Local Development (Recommended)

Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser to access DevTools. This is the fastest way to develop:

- **Tool listing** - See all registered tools and widgets
- **Input forms** - Test tools with custom inputs
- **Widget preview** - Render widgets in a mocked Apps SDK environment
- **Theme/locale switching** - Test different display modes

The DevTools mock the Apps SDK and the MCP apps runtimes, so your widget code works identically in both environments.

<Tip>
**Fast Iteration**

For full details on DevTools, HMR, and Vite plugin, see [Fast Iteration](/concepts/fast-iteration).

## Production Testing

When you're ready to test your AI App with an LLM, you can connect it to ChatGPT, Claude, or other compatible MCP clients.

### Testing in ChatGPT

ChatGPT uses the Apps SDK runtime and requires a public URL to connect to your app.

#### 1. Expose your server

ChatGPT needs a public URL to access your AI App. Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your local server:

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

Copy the forwarding URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app`).

#### 2. Connect to ChatGPT

1. In ChatGPT, go to **Profile → Apps → Create app**
2. Enter your ngrok URL with `/mcp` at the end:
   ```
   https://abc123.ngrok-free.app/mcp
   ```
3. Click **Create**

#### 3. Test your app

1. Start a new conversation
2. Select your app using the **+** button
3. Prompt the model to trigger your tools

#### Hot Module Reload

Widget changes in `web/src/widgets/` appear instantly without reconnecting.

Server changes in `server/src/` require starting a new conversation to take effect.

### Testing in Claude

Claude uses the MCP Apps runtime and requires a public URL to connect to your app.

#### 1. Expose your server

Claude needs a public URL to access your AI App. Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your local server:

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

Copy the forwarding URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app`).

#### 2. Connect to Claude

1. In Claude, go to **Settings → Connectors → Add Custom Connector** and configure your MCP server connection
2. Enter your App name and ngrok URL with `/mcp` at the end:
   ```
   https://abc123.ngrok-free.app/mcp
   ```
3. Click on **Add** 

#### 3. Test your app

1. Start a new conversation in Claude
2. Make sure your Connector is selected in the Connectors dropdown
3. Test widget interactions and tool responses

### Testing in other MCP Clients

Desktop MCP clients like VSCode, Goose, and others can connect directly to your local server without needing ngrok or a public URL.

#### 1. Start your server

Make sure your development server is running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your MCP server will be available at `http://localhost:3000/mcp`.

#### 2. Connect to your MCP client

Connect your server to any desktop MCP client that supports the [ext-apps specification](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps), such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Goose](https://goose.ai/), [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), or [MCPJam](https://mcpjam.com/). 


#### 3. Test your app

1. Configure your MCP client to connect to `http://localhost:3000/mcp`
2. Start a conversation in your MCP client
2. Test your app by invoking tools and interacting with the widgets
