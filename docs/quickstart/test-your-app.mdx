title: Test Your App
description: "Test your ChatGPT App locally with DevTools or in ChatGPT Developer Mode for integration testing."

Skybridge provides two ways to test your app: **local DevTools** for rapid iteration, and **ChatGPT** for integration testing.

## Local Development (Recommended)

Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser to access DevTools. This is the fastest way to develop:

- **Tool listing** - See all registered tools and widgets
- **Input forms** - Test tools with custom inputs
- **Widget preview** - Render widgets in a mocked ChatGPT environment
- **Theme/locale switching** - Test different display modes

The DevTools mock the `window.openai` API, so your widget code works identically in both environments.

<Tip>
**Fast Iteration**

For full details on the emulator, HMR, and Vite plugin, see [Fast Iteration](/concepts/fast-iteration).

**Want LLM-based conversations locally?**

For complete local emulation with real LLM conversations, check out [MCP Jam](https://mcpjam.com/) - a third-party tool that provides a full ChatGPT-like environment for testing MCP servers.

## Testing in ChatGPT

When you're ready to test the full integration with the LLM:

### 1. Expose your server

ChatGPT needs a public URL. Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your local server:

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

Copy the forwarding URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app`).

### 2. Connect to ChatGPT

1. In ChatGPT, go to **Profile → Apps → Create app**
2. Enter your ngrok URL with `/mcp` at the end:
   ```
   https://abc123.ngrok-free.app/mcp
   ```
3. Click **Create**

### 3. Test your app

1. Start a new conversation
2. Select your app using the **+** button
3. Prompt the model to trigger your tools

### Hot Module Reload

Widget changes in `web/src/widgets/` appear instantly in ChatGPT without reconnecting.

Server changes in `server/src/` require starting a new conversation to take effect.
