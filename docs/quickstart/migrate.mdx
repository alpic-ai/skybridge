Already have an app built with the [OpenAI Apps SDK](https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/) or [`@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps)? The Skybridge [Skill](/devtools/skills) can migrate it for you — it teaches your coding agent the full Skybridge framework so it can scaffold, rewrite, and wire up your project automatically.

## Install the skill

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npx skills add alpic-ai/skybridge -s skybridge
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx skills add alpic-ai/skybridge -s skybridge
```
```bash yarn
yarn dlx skills add alpic-ai/skybridge -s skybridge
```
```bash bun
bunx skills add alpic-ai/skybridge -s skybridge
```
```bash deno
deno run -A npm:skills add alpic-ai/skybridge -s skybridge
```
</CodeGroup>

## Prompt your agent

```
Migrate my app to /skybridge
```

That's it! Once migrated, keep using the [🧠 Skill](/devtools/skills) for ongoing development — brainstorming ideas, designing widgets and tools, running dev server, debugging, deploying, and more.
