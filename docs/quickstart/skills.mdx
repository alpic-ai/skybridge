<Tip>
Skills are pre-built instructions for your AI coding assistant. They work with **Antigravity**, **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, **Gemini CLI**, **GitHub Copilot**, **OpenAI Codex**, **Windsurf**, and more.
</Tip>

## What it does

Turn your AI assistant into a Skybridge expert that guides you through the full app lifecycle:

1. **Discovery** — Brainstorm your idea, validate it against UX guidelines, create specs
2. **Architecture** — Design UX flows, decide tools vs widgets, define the API shape
3. **Bootstrapping** — Scaffold the project from the starter template
4. **Implementation** — Data fetching, state management, LLM communication, UI guidelines, OAuth, CSP
5. **Run & Test** — Start the dev server and connect to AI assistants
6. **Deploy & Publish** — Ship to production and submit to app directories

## Installation

Add the Skybridge skill by running the following command:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npx skills add alpic-ai/skybridge -s skybridge
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx skills add alpic-ai/skybridge -s skybridge
```
```bash yarn
yarn dlx skills add alpic-ai/skybridge -s skybridge
```
```bash bun
bunx skills add alpic-ai/skybridge -s skybridge
```
```bash deno

```
</CodeGroup>

## Example Prompts
