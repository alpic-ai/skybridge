description: "Add Skybridge packages to your existing MCP server or React app for widget support and type inference."

Skybridge contains 2 main packages that can be used together or independently.

## The packages

- **`skybridge/server`**: A drop-in replacement for the official MCP SDK that adds widget registration and type inference capabilities.
- **`skybridge/web`**: A React library providing hooks, components, and the runtime glue to render your widgets inside ChatGPT's iframe environment.

## Option 1: use `skybridge/server` (Recommended)

<Card title="Use skybridge/server" icon="server" href="/quickstart/add-to-existing-app/server">
  **Best if**: you're using the official TypeScript MCP SDK and want to add rich UI widgets with full type safety.
</Card>

## Option 2: use `skybridge/web` only

<Card title="Use skybridge/web only" icon="browser" href="/quickstart/add-to-existing-app/web">
  **Best if**: you already have an MCP server in a non-TypeScript runtime and only want React hooks for UI components.
