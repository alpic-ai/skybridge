Skybridge enables you to build **ChatGPT Apps** and **MCP Apps**—interactive UI widgets that render inside AI conversations. Before diving into Skybridge's APIs, understand the underlying protocols and runtimes it builds upon.

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) is an open standard that allows AI models to connect with external tools, resources, and services. Think of it as an API layer specifically designed for LLMs.

An MCP server exposes:
- **Tools**: Functions the model can call (e.g., `search_flights`, `get_weather`)
- **Resources**: Data the model can access (e.g., files, UI components)

When you ask an AI assistant a question, it can invoke tools on your MCP server to fetch data or perform actions on your behalf.

## Two Runtimes, One Codebase

Skybridge supports two runtime environments for rendering widgets:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Apps SDK (ChatGPT)" icon="message" href="/fundamentals/apps-sdk">
    OpenAI's proprietary SDK for ChatGPT Apps. Uses `window.openai` API. Full feature set including modals and file operations.
  </Card>
  <Card title="MCP Apps" icon="plug" href="/fundamentals/mcp-apps">
    Open MCP ext-apps specification. Uses JSON-RPC postMessage bridge. Works across multiple AI clients.

## Comparison at a Glance

| Feature | Apps SDK (ChatGPT) | MCP Apps |
|---------|-------------------|----------|
| **Protocol** | Proprietary `window.openai` | Open MCP ext-apps spec |
| **Client Support** | ChatGPT only | Goose, VSCode, Postman, ... |
| **Specification** | Closed | [Open source](https://github.com/nicobrinkkemper/ext-apps) |

## What is a ChatGPT / MCP App?

A ChatGPT or MCP App consists of two components:

1. **MCP Server**: Handles your business logic and exposes tools
2. **UI Widgets**: React components that render in the AI's interface

When a tool is called, it can return both:
- **Text content**: What the model sees and responds with
- **Widget content**: A visual UI that renders for the user

This creates a **dual-surface interaction model**: users interact with both the conversational interface (the AI) and your custom UI (the widget).
